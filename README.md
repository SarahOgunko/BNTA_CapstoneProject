Description: Digital Marketplace, a website that displays a database of products and information about them.
## MVP

	* Product Price
	* Current Product Stock Level

* Customer details are stored in a database, which can be added and amended
* Customers are able to place order & buy products from the database
* Product stock levels adjust according to customer orders
* Order information is stored in an additional database

## Extensions
* Estimated Delivery Time (to customer based on given location/postcode)
* Faux STRIPE payment demonstration 

* Customer can pay a surplus to prioritise delivery
* Customer can designate items from an order to be delivered to a locker/hub if in person delivery is unsuccessful
* Customer can check items to include a delivery code (i.e. offered on items above a certain price)
